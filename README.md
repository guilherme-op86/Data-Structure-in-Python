Project 1: Hash Table with Linked Lists – Brazilian State Directory
Description
This project implements a basic hash table to store information about Brazilian states using their abbreviations (siglas). It uses separate chaining with singly linked lists to handle hash collisions. The hash function maps each abbreviation to a specific index in the table based on ASCII values, with special handling for "DF" (Federal District). Each state is stored as a node containing the abbreviation and full name.
Key Features
- Custom hash function for Brazilian state abbreviations
- Collision resolution using linked lists
- Lookup and insertion operations
- Console display of table contents
- Manual override for "DF" to be placed at index 7
Purpose
Created as part of the Systems Analysis and Development course to demonstrate data structure concepts in Python, especially the use of hash tables and linked lists.

 Project 2: Patient Queue with Priority Cards – Linked List System
Description
This project simulates a patient queue system using linked lists, where each patient is assigned a priority based on their card color: Green (G) or Yellow (Y). The structure dynamically adjusts patient placement depending on priority — Green card holders get added to the front, while Yellow card holders are inserted toward the end but before non-priority entries.
Key Features
- Dynamic insertion with and without priority
- Color-coded patient identifiers
- Interactive menu via console
- Manual assignment of card numbers
- Linked list implementation of queue behavior
Purpose
Designed to reinforce object-oriented programming and data structure concepts by simulating real-world queue management with conditional logic and efficient data handling.
